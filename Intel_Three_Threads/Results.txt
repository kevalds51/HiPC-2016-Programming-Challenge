Results
----------------

We observed the end-to-end time by varying the number threads being launched. By hit and trial, we observed that giving the number of threads = 4 gave us the desired output in a very less time. (Balancing computation and thread-communication).

So, following were our results with 3 iterations in the program.

Large Dataset
Number of threads launched = 4  * Best end-to-end time 	  (in secs)  = 40.530892  * Average end-to-end time (in secs)  = 40.851084 * Best Algorithm Time 	  (in usecs) = 25832368 * Average Algorithm Time  (in usecs) = 26154830

Medium Dataset
Number of threads launched = 4  * Best end-to-end time 	  (in secs)  = 9.419849  * Average end-to-end time (in secs)  = 9.635608 * Best Algorithm Time     (in usecs) = 5766563  * Average Algorithm Time  (in usecs) = 5977752
